# Micro

Micro is a set of text-parsing libraries. This package allows us to parse the text that the user provides through an editor.

I'm creating Micro to lay the foundations of a social networking platform that I have in mind. And, as you can easily guess, users in a social network interact mainly through a component that allows them to publish text, links, images, emoji and much more. For this reason, Micro contains many libraries that allow me to determine the amount of characters in a text, identify any link, username or hashtag.
