# Micro (Draft.js)

This is a set of packages that I studied during the development of Square. Thanks to the beautiful people at [draft-js-plugins](https://github.com/draft-js-plugins/), I could see how `draft-js` can be used to create very interesting editors.

Here you can find these packages:
 - [buttons](./packages/buttons)
 - [editor](./packages/editor)
 - [linkify](./packages/linkify)
 - [mention](./packages/mention)
 - [undo](./packages/undo)
 - [utils](./packages/utils)

These packages are a bit different from the ones built by [draft-js-plugins](https://github.com/draft-js-plugins/). I modified these packages in order to work better with the [Square web client](https://github.com/square-net/web).
